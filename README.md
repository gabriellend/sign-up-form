# sign-up-form
Done for my DevIsland students as part of the Odin Project.

The assignment was to create a sign-up-form similar to [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/5f37d43908ef92499e95a9b90fc3cc291a95014c/html_css/project-sign-up-form/sign-up-form.png). I took the black borders literally and played with the size of the viewport to see how it scaled down. Being an image, everything scaled down nice and proportionally. Even though it was out of the scope of the assignment, I decided to take on the challenge of achieving the same effect with css. I learned how to maintain the aspect ratio of an element and how to proportionally scale down its contents. The end result is pretty satisfying!
